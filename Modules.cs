// KillerPivot and KillerScripts, shipped inside the exe. Partial of MainWindow.
//
// Both are embedded resources (see the csproj) rather than files beside the app: KillerShell is
// one portable exe, and a user who copies it to a USB stick and runs it on a customer's machine
// gets the modules too, with no install, no PSGallery and no internet. That is the whole point -
// the machines these are most useful on are the ones you cannot install anything on.
//
// They are unpacked to LocalAppData rather than run from memory because PowerShell resolves
// modules by PATH: a module has to exist as a directory with a manifest in it before
// Import-Module or auto-loading can find it. The folder is stamped with the app version, so a
// KillerShell upgrade re-writes the modules instead of leaving an old copy in place forever.
